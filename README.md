to get this up and running you need to first run the heathcliff webscraper which gets all comics from 2002 to current from gocomics  
then you need to run the vintage scraper which gets all of the 1970s to 1990s comics that were archived by fans  
then edit the jimmy bot code with the bot token ID and update the maincog with the guildID and channelIDs as needed
then run jimmy-bot and boom simple heathcliff bot up and running :fire:
